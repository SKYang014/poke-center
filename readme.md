# PokÃ©Nav Online

Inspired by the recent new release of pokemon and my love for the overlooked 3rd generation, this application showcases a pokÃ©mon themed social media website. Users can create accounts, add friends and pokemon to their team, post thoughts and reactions, and manage their current team.

The application utilizes React, GraphQL, Apollo/Express, Bcrypt and JSON WEbtokens for Auth, MongoDB, and Node.js.
